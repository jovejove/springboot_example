Notice that ApplicationListener is generically parameterized with the type of your custom event (BlockedListEvent in the preceding example). This means that the onApplicationEvent() method can remain type-safe, avoiding any need for downcasting. You can register as many event listeners as you wish, but note that, by default, event listeners receive events synchronously. This means that the publishEvent() method blocks until all listeners have finished processing the event. One advantage of this synchronous and single-threaded approach is that, when a listener receives an event, it operates inside the transaction context of the publisher if a transaction context is available. If another strategy for event publication becomes necessary, see the javadoc for Springâ€™s ApplicationEventMulticaster interface and SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster implementation for configuration options.

The following example shows the bean definitions used to register and configure each of the classes above:
